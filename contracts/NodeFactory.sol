Things that I need to test for:

    ## Relationships
    1. Everything compiles ðŸ—¸
    2. Node can be created ðŸ—¸
    3. Multiple addresses can create individual nodes ðŸ—¸
    4. A Node's address can be publicly found from owner's address. ðŸ—¸
    5. An address cannot create multiple nodes ðŸ—¸
    6. Node name/content/owner can be read ðŸ—¸
    7. The Name/content can be modified by owner
    8. The name/content cannot be modified by non-owner
    9. That weights can be modified correctly on each side ðŸ—¸
    10. Weights cannot be greater than 100 nor less than 0 ðŸ—¸
    11. Weights to oneself cannot be changed ðŸ—¸
    12. That relationship(s) can be added ðŸ—¸
    13. An address cannot add a relationship to a node they do not own ðŸ—¸
    14. A node cannot add a relationship to itself.
    15. The relationship must be a valid node.
    16. A relationship can be deleted by owner
    17. A relationship cannot be deleted by someone who is not the owner
    18. Those relationships are publicly readable

    ## Child Nodes
    1. A Node can create a childnode
    3. The children's name/content can be read by owner
    4. The children's name/content can be read by the public
    5. The name/content cannot be change by owner nor public (imutable)
    6. A node can be abandoned
    7. A node can be signed by another address.

    ## Multiple children
    1. A parent can create multiple children at the same level
    2. A parent can create a childNode with a childNode as its parent
    2. A parent can create a spanning tree of children
    3. A node can be reparented if owner owns both previous parent and future parent
